title: What is DownZemAll
---

**DownZemAll! is a mass download manager** for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. It helps you to select, organize, prioritize and run your downloads in parallel.

Based on the [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/ "https://www.qt.io/") framework, DownZemAll! is written in C/C++. It's a free (as in "*free speech*" and also as in "*free beer*") software. Its use is governed by [LGPL](/DownZemAll/LICENSE.txt "LICENSE") License.

**DownRightNow is an add-on for Chrome/Firefox**. It connects *DownZemAll!* with your web browser. This extension helps you to download all the links and media you can find on the Web. When you visit a page, click to DownRightNow to see the content of the page. The content are links, references, images, videos... and other media present on the page.

I hope you enjoy DownZemAll! as much as I enjoy coding it.
