To run DownZemAll with a 'double-clickable' shortcut instead of as command line
from a terminal, use the following scripts to add (or remove) the desktop 
shortcut:

- install_shortcut_desktop.sh
( uninstall_shortcut_desktop.sh )

=> The script configures DownZemAll.desktop and copies it to the desktop.
